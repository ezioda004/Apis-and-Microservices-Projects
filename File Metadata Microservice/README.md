## Installation

### Quick Setup

This webapp uses nodemon, so make sure you have that installed, if not then run this command:

```
npm install -g nodemon
```

After installing nodemon, run these commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

In the terminal it should say which port the server it's running on, if it's local server then you can head to `localhost:1337`


## User Stories:

* User can submit a form that includes a file upload.
* The from file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
* When user submit something, they will receive the file name and name, type and size in bytes within the JSON response.

## Example Usage:

- Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.
